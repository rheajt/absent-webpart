# Absent Faculty

## Summary

Create a display for teachers who are out and teachers who are covering for those teachers. This webpart gets displayed on the division pages, so that teachers can be aware of where people are in the building.

This relies on maintaining a single Sharepoint List that is accessible on a public Sharepoint Communication site.
